===================== TASK ONE ===================== 

Create an app that allows the user to filter data 
using a search bar.

1.  You must complete the task in 10 minutes
2.  The search function must simulate a 'LIKE' SQL 
    query where only results containing the value
    of the search bar are returned
3.  The app must use local state i.e. this.state and 
    this.setState()
4.  Your html markup must use semantic elements 
    (Use elements other than <div></div>)

===================== TASK TWO ===================== 

Update your app to use redux to manage app state.

1.  You must complete the task in 10 minutes
2.  You must not use local state i.e. Your code must
    not have this.state and this.setState()
3.  Your redux setup must either use actions or action
    creators and reducers to change redux state

====================================================

==================== TASK THREE ==================== 

Refactor your code to initialize the app's local 
state to the array of the data constant (const data).

e.g. this.state = { data: [ data ] }

Then create a promise to asynchronously load the 
array from the asyncData constant (const async Data)
into the app's state.

1.  You must complete the task in 10 minutes
2.  The unfiltered list must contain results from
    both data sets (const data and const async Data)
3.  The promise must be resolved 3 seconds after the
    app's first render i.e. after 3 seconds, 
    this.state = { data: [ data and asyncData ] }
