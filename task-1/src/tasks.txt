======================= TASK ======================= 

Create an app that allows the user to filter data 
using a search bar. Then create a promise to 
asynchronously load the array from the asyncData 
constant (const async Data) into the app's state.

1.  You must complete the task in 15 minutes
2.  The search function must simulate a 'LIKE' SQL 
    query where only results containing the value
    of the search bar are returned
3.  The promise must be resolved 3 seconds after the
    app's first render i.e. after 3 seconds, 
    this.state = { data: [ data and asyncData ] }
4.  The unfiltered list should contain results from
    both data sets (const data and const async Data)
5.  Your html markup must use semantic elements
    (Use elements other than <div></div>)
